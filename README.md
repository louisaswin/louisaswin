**About Me**
- 👋 Hi, I’m Louisa, a data enthusiast with a background in statistics and psychology.
- 🔍 I'm passionate about data analytics, machine learning, and data ethics, driven by my curiosity for uncovering trends and insights.
- 👀 Beyond data, I'm an avid reader, a fan of games, and a movie lover. My background in psychology and neuroscience fuels my interest in human behavior and Women's and Gender Studies (WGST). 
- 😊 Feel free to connect with me to discuss any of these interests or to collaborate on exciting projects!
